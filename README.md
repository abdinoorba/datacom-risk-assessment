# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment — RetailNova (Datacom Forage Simulation)

## Project Overview

**Scenario:**  
As a Cybersecurity Analyst in a simulated Datacom engagement, I conducted a comprehensive risk assessment for RetailNova Pty Ltd., a nationwide retailer with 85 locations and a growing e-commerce platform.

**Objective:**  
Identify, evaluate, and mitigate key organizational risks — including cyber threats, natural disasters, and insider threats — affecting the company’s infrastructure, data, and workforce.

## Methodology

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 1. Context Definition | Assessed sensitive assets such as customer data, payment systems, intellectual property, and IT infrastructure. |
| 2. Threat Identification | Evaluated top risks — Cyber Threat, Natural Disaster, and Insider Threat — based on organizational context and recent incident trends. |
| 3. Risk Analysis | Determined likelihood × impact levels using an Excel-based Risk Matrix (color-coded). |
| 4. Mitigation Planning | Proposed additional control measures such as multi-factor authentication, data backup systems, disaster recovery planning, and employee training. |
| 5. Residual Risk Evaluation | Calculated target risk ratings after controls to measure the improvement in the company’s overall risk posture. |

## Key Results

- Identified three primary risk categories: Cyber Threat, Natural Disaster, and Insider Threat.  
- Used quantitative and qualitative analysis to prioritize risks based on impact and likelihood.  
- Recommended mitigations that reduced overall organizational risk from Extreme to Medium–High.  
- Demonstrated practical GRC application — including threat modeling, risk scoring, and control analysis.
